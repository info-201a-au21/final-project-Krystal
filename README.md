# Final Project
Use this `REAMDE.md` file to describe your final project (as detailed on Canvas).

* **Why are you interested in this field/domain?**
  * We are interested in this field because we're all huge Netflix people, and while looking at different fields for our final project we started thinking about movies and Netflix seemed like the perfect platform to go with, especially considering what a data-driven company they are (they're the surprising outlier in FAANG - although, it would probably be MAANG now ðŸ˜†)
* **What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?**
  * We found lots of examples of how Netflix uses data, most seemed to highlight their algorithm and the 93% success rate of Netflix Originals:
