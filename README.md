# Final Project
Use this `REAMDE.md` file to describe your final project (as detailed on Canvas).

* **Why are you interested in this field/domain?**
  * We are interested in this field because we're all huge Netflix people, and while looking at different fields for our final project we started thinking about movies and Netflix seemed like the perfect platform to go with, especially considering what a data-driven company they are (they're the surprising outlier in FAANG - although, it would probably be MAANG now ðŸ˜†)
* **What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?**
  * We found lots of examples of how Netflix uses data, most seemed to highlight their algorithm and the 93% success rate of Netflix Originals:

* **What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?**
  * What is the genre distribution of Netflix original content compared to all content available on Netflix?
  * Is there a correlation between genres and ratings?
  * How many movies & TV shows were released on Netflix in 2020?

# Finding Data
Dataset 1: netflix_originals

  * We got the data from kaggleâ€™s dataset collection, using a url to download and get it into github. The url is https://www.kaggle.com/luiscorter/netflix-original-films-imdb-scores. 
* **How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?**
  *
* **How many observations (rows) are in your data?**
  *
* **How many features (columns) are in the data?**
  *
* **What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?**
